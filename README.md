## conclusions

At the end of this project this these are my conclusions  for it : 

First I cleaned the dataset by **removing** **empty** and **dupliacted** values. 

After that, I started to investigate on data 

The size of the dataframe was **1547378**



And the number of female visitors was **71840**. It represents **65%**

And males were **38687** **35%**

 And most hospital visitors come from **JARDIM CAMBURI** Neighborhood

And the number of patients who received SMS for their appmoveat was **75045** , **35483** was not recvueing 

And the number of patients who have scholarships was **99666**. **10861** did not have scholarships.

## Limitations

1- Data about patients was not enough about the SLA of appointment, which is important in my view 

2- Also they did't show the last visit of a patient 

3- They also need to check if the patient  will come or not , by calling them , not by sending SMS
